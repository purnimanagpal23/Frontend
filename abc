COVID and Flu Forecasting Pages
Data Dictionary and Mockup Notes
As of October 17, 2024

Map
Default view (before user selection)
•	Forecast date: 2 weeks ahead (target=14 day ahead inc hosp)
•	No states are selected/highlighted
•	Text box uses United States information
o	location_name=US
o	Line 1: “Projected hospital admissions per 500k” uses per500k value when quantile=0.500
o	Line 2: “95% credible interval” uses per500k value when quantile=0.025 and quantile=0.975
•	State colors/category come from category column
o	I recommend making the category-to-hex color match in JS, because we’re still finalizing the categories/bins that will be used in the final product
Map info
•	(test dataset using COVID data) test_covid_map_us.csv
o	Pull-out box
	Box text: “Projected XX hospital admissions per 500k (95% confidence interval: YY-ZZ hospital admissions per 500k)”
Time interval selected	XX hospital admissions	YY (“YY-ZZ hospital admissions”)	ZZ (“YY-ZZ hospital admissions”)
1 week	per500k when quantile=0.50 and target=”7 day inc hosp”	per500k when quantile=0.025 and target=”7 day inc hosp”	per500k when quantile=0.975 and target=”7 day inc hosp”

2 weeks	per500k when quantile=0.50 and target=”14 day inc hosp”
	per500k when quantile=0.025 and target=”14 day inc hosp”
	per500k when quantile=0.975 and target=”14 day inc hosp”

•	COVID and Flu final datasets in progress
•	Note: unsure if we’ll use Puerto Rico, American Samoa, Virgin Islands data in the map
•	Note: The categories are still in progress (i.e. the final map may not be “per 500k residents”). But the overall map structure is the same: 50 states + DC, bins/categorical values, with two forecast targets

Timeseries
Default view (before user selection)
•	Historical data: US
•	Confidence interval: 95%
•	Forecast selection: Ensemble forecast
o	Test dataset model name: FluSight-ensemble
o	COVID and Flu final model names in progress
Historical data
•	(test dataset using flu data) target-hospital-admissions.csv
o	COVID historical data will eventually come from here: covid19-forecast-hub/target-data at main · CDCgov/covid19-forecast-hub (github.com)
o	Flu historical data from here: FluSight-forecast-hub/target-data/target-hospital-admissions.csv at main · cdcepi/FluSight-forecast-hub (github.com)
o	Keeping historical data separate from forecast data for now, since historical data changes along with forecast data (but can discuss if this should be combined with forecasts data)
Forecast data
•	(test dataset using flu data) test_forecasts.csv
o	All of the forecasted values are in the columns that begin with quantile_0.XXX
	target_end_date is the date associated with the forecasts in the quantile columns
o	location_name (or abbreviation) tied to location drop-down/selection
o	model is tied to the model selection checkboxes
o	Timeseries construction
	Forecast value comes from quantile_0.5
	95% credible interval bounds come from quantile_0.025 (lower) and quantile_0.975 (upper)
	50% credible interval bounds come from quantile_0.25 (lower) and quantile_0.75 (upper)
o	Note: unsure if we’ll use Puerto Rico data
Select models section
•	Model names
o	There aren’t the same number of forecasts per state – so if a model is unavailable, please grey it out
o	The number of models will change every week because some models might drop off, while other models might be added. The final list will come from the CSVs that COVID and flu will compile and send
o	Flu: eventually match names and hyperlinks to “Contributing teams and models” section on this page (note: still don’t have final list of model names yet)
•	Final model colors are still WIP. Please use test colors for now!
